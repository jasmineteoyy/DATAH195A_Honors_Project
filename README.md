# DATA H195A Honors Project: Building A Recommender Using Spotify's Web API: "Spotipy"

## DataSet:
Spotipy is the “lightweight python library” for Spotify’s Web API that gives developers full access to all of Spotify’s music data. For the purposes of this project, the dataset consists of the following features: danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence (positiveness), tempo, song_type, id, uri, track-href, analysis_url, duration_ms, time_signature, genre, album, popularity (popularity score), artist_name, and track_name. They contain raw data on the sound and musicality of each soundtrack, reducing any kind of bias and censoring of data. Note that popularity scores may contain bias based on the user who gave the rating.
